Project Introduction 
#####################
This developed solution is intended to be a minimal working example of a standard operating procedures (SOPs) digital library. This solution offers an elegant user interface for navigating each SOP in our library. 

Our SOPs are intended to function a set of written detailed instructions, or step – by – step instructions, 
on how to complete a single business process.
