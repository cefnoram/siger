Project Introduction 
#####################

This developed solution is intended to be a minimal working example of a standard operating procedures (SOPs) digital library. This will provide a more user friendly user interface for navigating the SOP library. Our SOPs are intended to function a set of written detailed instructions, or step – by – step instructions, 
on how to complete a single business process.
