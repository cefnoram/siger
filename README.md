This is a project that I created to address several particular design flaws that were present in our corporate standard operating procedures digital library. The current digital library...is one directory and all SOPs are composed in MS Word documents. 

Our digital library is inherently:

* not user friendly;

* will be confusing to novice users;

* does not scale well and

* it lacks professionalism.

I created this solution the address these design flaws. 

Now our SOP digital library has an elegant user interface. It is easy to navigate from one SOP to the next. It is well organized, and it looks professional. 

Our new digital library is hosted -- for free -- by read the docs dot ORG. 

And our SOPs can be viewed here `Read The Docs URL: siger.readthedocs.org`

So, perhaps at this point you are asking what is a standard operating procedure (SOP)? 

I define them as — SOPs are intended to function a set of written detailed instructions, or step – by – step instructions, on how to complete a single business process.
