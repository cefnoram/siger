Introduction
-------------
A TrackIt work order goes through many status changes from initial creation until full completion. Once the work order status has been changed to Completed to be invoiced there are additional steps that need to be performed. We need to notify the customer that their machine is finished so we can collect payment. You are required to create a Quickbooks invoice which will detail the level of service provided and the amount of money due.

Processes
---------
#. From TrackIt main window, click Current View button=>Public View=>Completed to be invoiced. This provides you with all TrackIt Work Orders with the completed to be invoiced work status.

#. Next, from the main TrackIt work order window, click on the Resolution Tab. The Resolution Tab is where the technician will articulate the full scope of service preformed.

#. Next open Quickbooks and create new invoice. If you need additional detailed information on the proper steps for creating a Quickbooks invoice see SOP G002 Create an Invoice.

#. In the Item column click in the blank field then begin typing labor, and chose labor from the list. Labor is always the first work order entry.

   a. Next, the Resolution Tab will provide you with all the details about the amount of labor hours that were required to complete the repair and/or service we provided. You will add the total number of labor hours from the TrackIt work order resolution tab to the Quickbooks invoice quantity column. So, if the technician states two hours of labor were required to complete this job, you will add “2” to the invoice quantity column.

   b. Next you will write in past tense (we have already done the work), the labor description from the resolution tab of the TrackIt window, to the description column of your Quickbooks invoice. Your abbreviated description to the Quickbooks invoice should be a shorter and more concise version of the technicians’ description from the TrackIt work order/resolution tab.

   c. The last line in the labor description is required to state, “Diagnosed Dell Inspiron N14430 [specific name of machine] tested and verified working.”

#. Click in the Item column and add other relative items (e.g., hardware, software, anything that was replaced, etc.) to complete the work order.

#. Verify your work is accurate and complete. Click Save and Exit.

#. Re-open the work order and added the Quickbooks Invoice number to the notes section.

*Resolution Tab*: 
    From the TrakIt main work order window you will notice a tab titled Resolution. The information contained on the resolution tab is crucial to this task.

Additional Information
----------------------
