Introduction
-------------
The invoices from the previous business day must be filled on the next available business day. This is an important task and must be done accurately. We archive all our sales invoices to assure that we are being transparent in the case of an audit by the government of Belize.  At the end of each month, the entire month stack of invoices are filled and stored.  


Processes
---------
#. In this initial step you will use a manila envelope and cut it in two parts (horizontally or long ways). Now that the manila folder is in two sections, you will label the top portion with the appropriate month and year. 

#. You will use a two whole punch to make holes in the top two inch section of the manila envelope.  

#. Next, you will insert a Prestong prong paper fasteners into the wholes of the bottom part. As you file the invoices, you will use the two whole punch to make two holes in each invoices/work order/purchase order and attach each face up to the prong paper fastener.    

#. At the end of the month you will attach the top portion of the manila folder (month and year facing up, readable) to the Prestong prong paper fasteners, and fold the fasteners flat, securing the stack together. 

Scope
-----
Anyone who is working at the front desk will be responsible for one or all parts of this business process. It is important to read and understand the steps involved in this business process prior to undertaking this task.


Definitions
-----------
*A Work Order*: 
    Is generated for all customers requesting customer primes work, repair(s), or service. 
*Purchase Order*: 
    Are created for commercial clients. These commercial clients are required to present the Purchase Order at the time they pay their bill. Consequently, you will retain the Purchase Order and file it with the invoice on the next business day. 
*Quickbooks Invoice*: 
    Is created for all work or service and all purchases at or retail location. You will have to make a note of your work or number. 
.. seealso::
    See **SOP G002-Invoice** on detailed information on the proper procedures for creating a Quickbooks invoice.  
*Credit Memo*: 
    Is generated by management for varying reasons, but one reason might be if SigerTronic Systems needs new ink for our printer. A Credit Memo would be created for this transaction. Credit memos will have a work order number but the will return an error message when running Quickbooks search (Quickbooks=>Edit=>Search) for the specific work order number. Credit memos are processed at the end of the month; therefore, a credit memo will be missing in the filing process. A gap (not consecutive numbers) in your invoice numbers will be created. It is best practice to label the location in the stack of invoice with a sticky note as a reminder that you have to print the credit memo before the task is complete.  

Addational Information
----------------------
* All SigerTronics Systems invoices are numbered consecutively, and throughout this process of filing the invoices, your quality check is that a complete range of invoices numbers’ (from #xxyy to xxxx) are filed. If there is a missing invoice number, for example you just filed invoice # 6345 and the next invoice to be filed is #6347, you can deduce that you must search Quickbooks for the missing invoice # 6346. It is common to have a gap in your invoice numbers while filing. One example of a missing invoice number is a “Credit Memo”. 
* Invoices with a work order number associated must have copy of the physical work order attached when filing the invoice. Additionally, some corporate customers will provide Purchase Orders when paying their bill. You will need to file the Purchase Order (or work order) with the invoice. Note: When service or repair of customer equipment is complete, you should print the invoice and place it on the physical machine. This is in preparation for the customer arrival to pay for their service and expedites the checkout process.  
* When printing invoices, any invoice four lines or less will print on half page logo paper, and five lines or more need to be printed on a full page log paper. To change this setting, in the main Quickbooks invoice window, click in the “Template” drop down box=>chose “Half page” or “Logo Invoice”, logo invoice is the full page option.
