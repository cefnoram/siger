Introduction
-------------
The invoices from the previous business day must be filled on the next available business day. This is an important task and must be done accurately. We archive all our sales invoices to assure that we are being transparent in the case of an audit by the government of Belize.  At the end of each month, the entire month stack of invoices are filled and stored.

Definitions
-----------
*Tech-pricing*: 
    is a term used to state that an individual is receiving a discount on items purchased in our retail store location. The types of individuals who are available for our Tech-pricing discount vary, but a short list is, SigerTronic Systems technicians/employees, schools, students, etc.  If you have questions regarding who is eligible or not eligible for tech-pricing see management prior to granting tech-pricing.

*Master price list*: 
    Is a list of all stock items in our inventory. The master price list provides information such as detailed item description, cost before tax, cost after tax, and actual tech-pricing cost.  

Addational Information
----------------------
* If you need to delete an item from your open invoice, select the line item with your mouse pointer, and right click, then chose delete from the drop down box.

* Be sure to verify your work is absolutely correct prior to saving the invoice.  Once you have saved the invoice you cannot make any changes.

* Customers receiving "Tech-pricing" (e.g., SigerTronic Systems technicians, schools, students, etc.), you must first check the master price list, and then adjust the value in the rate column appropriately for the item being sold. 

* There are two ways to create an invoice from a QuickBooks sales order, first by starting from an existing sales order, and second by starting with a new (blank) invoice. If you want to create an invoice for more than one sales order, you have to start with a new invoice.
